        description:
          Most applications of AI and machine learning are being powered by huge amounts of data in all sorts of forms. Sometimes this data is encapsulated in PDFs, images, video or audio files, but you would still want the possibility to extract and leverage this data.
          During this session you will get an introduction to the cognitive services that Microsoft has to offer and how to combine these services with Azure Cognitive Search for extracting and analyzing your data.
          In addition we will discuss some broader AI concepts, the ingest-enrich-explore pattern and how this all fits together with leveraging the cognitive services.
          After the session you will be able to infuse your own applications with some AI or a full-blown intelligent search experience.

        description: If you've been working with ARM templates, you have probably heard about Bicep. If you have found the Bicep repository on GitHub, you might have followed the tutorials already. But how do you take the next steps? In this session, we will focus on what an enterprise environment needs from Infrastructure as Code and how Bicep can help you out. We will look at the basics like loops and conditions, but will also take some real-life examples to see how we can make use of modules. Combining it with CICD pipelines will give you a complete solution to start implementing in your own environment.
