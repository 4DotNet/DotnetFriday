        description: If you've been working with ARM templates, you have probably heard about Bicep. If you have found the Bicep repository on GitHub, you might have followed the tutorials already. But how do you take the next steps? In this session, we will focus on what an enterprise environment needs from Infrastructure as Code and how Bicep can help you out. We will look at the basics like loops and conditions, but will also take some real-life examples to see how we can make use of modules. Combining it with CICD pipelines will give you a complete solution to start implementing in your own environment.
