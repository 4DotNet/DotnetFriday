    sessions:
      - title: Design Patterns for implementing Event Sourcing in .NET
        start: 17:00
        end: 18:00
        description:
          Event Sourcing is becoming more mainstream these days, and a lot of conferences have demonstrated the pros
          and cons of this artitecture style from multiple angles. I've done a few of these and publishes a lot of
          articles on best practices and solutions to common problems. But what nobody did was to show you how to
          build an event sourced systems in the .NET ecosystem. There are a lot of open-source projects that you can
          use, so you'll need to find a right mix and your own code to that. So let me show you how I would implement
          this in .NET with almost 10 years of Event Sourcing experience behind my belt.

      - title: The Toolshed - Inside Microsoft Azure TOOLS - Your daily hammers
        start: 19:00
        end: 20:30
        description:
          Visual Studio, MSFT’s flagship tool is available for almost every purpose now and people just love it. With it came the new
          release of the online version and also one for Microsoft Azure integrated in Azure App Services (“Monaco”). This doesn’t
          make the choice of tooling easier on all of us. And thus maybe it’s about time to take a look what we can do with all the
          available tools and which tools are your best tools of the trade. And is there such a thing as “One Tool to rule’em all”?
          This session will hopefully enlighten your path to Microsoft Azure Tooling (for Dev, IT Pro and asset Management)


          In January 2012 he became a crew member of AZUG, the Belgian Microsoft Azure User Group. As an active member he’s both involved in giving
          presentations and organizing events (like ITProceed, Techorama and Global Azure Bootcamp aka GAB). Mike was also a Microsoft
          Azure MVP (awarded 5 times since 2013, received his Fifth in July 2017! ) and Microsoft Azure Advisor.


          Helping out in the community and introducing new & young people into the world of Microsoft and technology is also one of his passions.
