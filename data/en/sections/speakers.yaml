          About 70% of businesses are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks through their supply chains. According to institutes, such as the Dutch National Intelligence Services and ENISA, this number is rising and poses a threat to the continuity of businesses.
          In this session, Suzanne Rijnbergen will focus on examples of supply chain attacks by cybercriminals that illustrate the challenges organisations face. She will detail different national and international initiatives ongoing in this area and provide insightful knowledge on how organizations can start securing their supply chain themselves.
