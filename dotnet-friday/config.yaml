            Are you mocking your dependencies, especially during unit tests? Tired of setting up infrastructure before
            running your integration tests? There are other ways to go about this! Testcontainers are a lightweight,
            disposable means of running your infrastructure such as a database. In this session we will explore the
            different ways in which we can use the excellent Testcontainers-dotnet library and hopefully give you
            solid foundation of using it in your own projects.

          title: "Star Tours - Event Sourcing at Cosmic Scale"
          abstract: |-
            Set in the Star Wars universe, Star Tours is a Disney theme park attraction that takes passengers on a turbulent trip across the
            galaxy. You might have ridden it, but have you ever stopped and thought about the complexity of running such an interplanetary
            travelling agency?

            Event Sourcing can help us tackle this complexity by storing state as a series of events that include the 'why' and 'when' of the
            specific event. Cosmos DB, the multi-model globally distributed database service on Azure is a great fit for storing these events.

            In this demo-heavy session I'll show you how to build an event store on Cosmos DB starting from scratch. Topics include bulk
            operations using stored procedures, partitioning strategies, and how to create projections using the Cosmos DB Change Feed. After
            this session, you'll be ready to start your own galactic travelling agency!
