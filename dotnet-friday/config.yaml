          title: "Govern your Azure environment through Azure Policy"
          abstract: |-
            When your Azure environment is relatively small, it is straightforward to keep track of what resources you have running in Azure and make sure that your solution is secure, compliant, and cost-effective. When your cloud workload gets bigger, and you have a lot of subscriptions and multiple management groups, that is much harder to do. Luckily, Azure has a built-in feature called Azure Policy that can help you govern your Azure resources. But how do we implement policies, guarantee compliance and security, without decreasing developer agility? This session will teach you how to deploy policies using Infrastructure as Code. You will see how to use the built-in policies and how to create your own. We will look at all the different effects that a policy can have and which should be used when. You will learn how to assign policies on different scopes and finally how to review the compliance status. All with the goal to enforce security, be compliant, monitor that continuously, and keep costs at bay.

          title: "The art of getting ðŸ’© done"
          abstract: |-
            Do you want to call in sick for the half day of Sprint Planning every other week? Do you take every excuse to cancel your pre-refinement meeting with your product owner and simply want to stand up and leave the actual refinement after debating the sizing of a story for 20 minutes? Do you just feel that all that sprinting is just not working for you?

            If that's the case, this session is for you! Over the last few years, we have seen an explosion in methodologies, frameworks and ways of working within IT. But is this helping us in getting more sh*t done? Sometimes, but not always. Whenever given the opportunity and the right context, I try do things differently. In this session I will share what I dislike about some of the things happening in our industry, and how I have approached things in three different teams over the last few years.

            So please join Henry Been in this session where he reflects on ten years of working in software development and the things that have helped him getting ðŸ’© done.

  #       - title: Star Tours - Event Sourcing at Cosmic Scale
  #         start: 19:05
  #         end: 20:05
  #         description:
  #           Set in the Star Wars universe, Star Tours is a Disney theme park attraction that takes passengers on a turbulent trip across the
  #           galaxy. You might have ridden it, but have you ever stopped and thought about the complexity of running such an interplanetary
  #           travelling agency?

  #           Event Sourcing can help us tackle this complexity by storing state as a series of events that include the 'why' and 'when' of the
  #           specific event. Cosmos DB, the multi-model globally distributed database service on Azure is a great fit for storing these events.

  #           In this demo-heavy session I'll show you how to build an event store on Cosmos DB starting from scratch. Topics include bulk
  #           operations using stored procedures, partitioning strategies, and how to create projections using the Cosmos DB Change Feed. After
  #           this session, you'll be ready to start your own galactic travelling agency!

      DotnetFriday events always start at 16:30 CEST. We allow attendees to arrive and settle with a drink for about half an hour.
      The first session typically starts at 17:00 CEST. A usual DotnetFriday evening looks like so:

      | Start (CEST) | End (CEST) |    |
      |--------------|------------|----|
      | 16:30 | 17:00 | Walk in, take a drink and have a chat |
      | 17:00 | 18:00 | First session of the evening |
      | 18:00 | 18:50 | End of the session, starting dinner |
      | 18:50 | 19:05 | Lightning talk (this timeslot is optional does not always take place) |
      | 19:10 | 20:10 | Second session of the evening (might start 10 minutes earlierin case of no lightning talk) |
      | 20:10 | 23:00 | Drinks and bites, having a chat and a laugh |

      We strive to make DotnetFriday as fun as possible. We invite you to stay for a drink and have a laugh after the last session
      finished, although we do understand those who leave and enjoy their evening elsewhere. Please note that we may deviate from
      the standard program here and there, each and every DotnetFriday edition is unique ;)
