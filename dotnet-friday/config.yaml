  #         start: 19:05
  #         end: 20:05
  #         description:
  #           Set in the Star Wars universe, Star Tours is a Disney theme park attraction that takes passengers on a turbulent trip across the
  #           galaxy. You might have ridden it, but have you ever stopped and thought about the complexity of running such an interplanetary
  #           travelling agency?

  #           Event Sourcing can help us tackle this complexity by storing state as a series of events that include the 'why' and 'when' of the
  #           specific event. Cosmos DB, the multi-model globally distributed database service on Azure is a great fit for storing these events.

  #           In this demo-heavy session I'll show you how to build an event store on Cosmos DB starting from scratch. Topics include bulk
  #           operations using stored procedures, partitioning strategies, and how to create projections using the Cosmos DB Change Feed. After
  #           this session, you'll be ready to start your own galactic travelling agency!

      DotnetFriday events always start at 16:30 CEST. We allow attendees to arrive and settle with a drink for about half an hour.
      The first session typically starts at 17:00 CEST. A usual DotnetFriday evening looks like so:

      | Start (CEST) | End (CEST) |    |
      |--------------|------------|----|
      | 16:30 | 17:00 | Walk in, take a drink and have a chat |
      | 17:00 | 18:00 | First session of the evening |
      | 18:00 | 18:50 | End of the session, starting dinner |
      | 18:50 | 19:05 | Lightning talk (this timeslot is optional does not always take place) |
      | 19:10 | 20:10 | Second session of the evening (might start 10 minutes earlierin case of no lightning talk) |
      | 20:10 | 23:00 | Drinks and bites, having a chat and a laugh |

      We strive to make DotnetFriday as fun as possible. We invite you to stay for a drink and have a laugh after the last session
      finished, although we do understand those who leave and enjoy their evening elsewhere. Please note that we may deviate from
      the standard program here and there, each and every DotnetFriday edition is unique ;)
