# DotnetFriday = May 2022 Edition

The .NET MAUI world is slowly taking over. This new revolution of front-end experience for .NET developers is gaining more and more popularity. Time ti invite Gerald Versluis, for an introduction. At the same time, we have seen what issues in your supply chain can do. The Log4J problem existed world-wide, because the Log4J package is a largely used packake. Suzanne Rijnbergen, Director ICS and Cybersecurity at Accenture tells us how to prevent supply chain attacks.

### Session: Introduction to App Development with .NET MAUI

.NET MAUI provides an extremely flexible and powerful way to create apps for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows, from very simple to extremely robust and complex. Is this one size fits all? Where should you start? In this session I'll run through what .NET MAUI is, how it fits in the .NET ecosystem, differences with Xamarin and how to get started yourself!

About 70% of businesses are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks through their supply chains. According to institutes, such as the Dutch National Intelligence Services and ENISA, this number is rising and poses a threat to the continuity of businesses.

In this session, Suzanne Rijnbergen will focus on examples of supply chain attacks by cybercriminals that illustrate the challenges organisations face. She will detail different national and international initiatives ongoing in this area and provide insightful knowledge on how organizations can start securing their supply chain themselves.
