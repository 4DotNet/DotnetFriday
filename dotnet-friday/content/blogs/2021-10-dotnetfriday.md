# DotnetFriday - October 2021 edition

A security edition. This time with Maik van der Gaag and Eduard Keilholz (me) as speakers. Maik went through the Azure Portal and showed us click by click how you can secure your services and set up a virtual network as a first security boundary. Then we continues with a session about how to bring your services from your DevOps environment in production in a secure way using DevSecOps with Azure DevOps

He loves to share is knowledge which was also one of the reasons why he founded the Dutch Cloud Meetup. Maik is a public speaker, writes blogs and organizes events. Microsoft has recognized him as Microsoft Azure MVP.

### Session: Security measures for Azure PaaS
One of the characteristics of Platform as a Service components in Azure is that they are open for the complete world by default Azure PaaS offers great services but you do not want to have them open by default in many situations. For this reasons I see many companies switching back the known functionalities (IaaS) but that should not be the case. In this session you will learn how to secure services like Azure Functions, Azure App Service, Azure SQL Databases with the use of Azure Front Door, Azure Private Link and Virtual Networks and many more.

### Session: Deploy your API secured, with a DevOps CI/CD pipeline

This session is all about DevOps and CI/CD. I will build an ASP.NET WebApi from scratch and deploy it using an Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline and Infrastructure as Code. I will show you how different ARM templates are compared to the new Bicep DSL, and discuss the advantages of building and deploying in an automated fashion.
