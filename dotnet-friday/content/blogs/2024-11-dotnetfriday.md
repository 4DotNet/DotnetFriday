# DotnetFriday - November 2024 Edition

The latest edition of DotnetFriday was all about Microsoft .NET Conf and the launch of .NET 9. It was an inspiring day filled with valuable insights into the latest developments within the .NET ecosystem.

Johnny Hooyberghs kicked things off with an overview of the newest features in .NET 9 and C# 13. He explained complex new capabilities in an accessible way, providing the audience with practical tools to start working with the updates immediately.

Roelant Dieben then focused on the improvements in Entity Framework Core, with special attention to the new APIs for CosmosDB. His session provided a deep dive into how these updates help developers work more efficiently and flexibly with data.

Alex de Groot emphasized the importance of carefully selecting underlying container images. He highlighted the benefits of using smaller, more efficient, and less capable containers that provide exactly what is needed. This not only improves performance but also reduces security risks.

Finally, Florian van Dillen shared his knowledge about .NET Aspire and its powerful combination with Dapr. He demonstrated how this toolset, which has truly matured with .NET 9, is essential for anyone developing a modern .NET backend.

All in all, it was an engaging and informative edition of DotnetFriday, where attendees were thoroughly updated on the future of .NET and how they can immediately apply the latest technologies to their own projects.
